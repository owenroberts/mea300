	<p>The principal element that separates games from other mediums is interaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Interaction</h2>
	<p>Interaction is created with input/output systems or cycles between the player 
and machine of feedback and response.</p>
	<p>The system of interaction in a game generally should:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Encourage exploration and understanding of the interface</li>
		<li>Encourage discovery and exploration within the game world</li>
		<li>Allow the user to master the tools of the game</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Input</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Keyboard & mouse</li>
		<li>Gamepad (joystick + buttons)</li>
		<li>Voice or sound</li>
		<li>3d sensing - Kinect, Wii</li>
		<li>Arcade guns (light sensing)</li>
		<li>Other haptic sensors</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Output</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Video</li>
		<li>Audio</li>
		<li>Haptic</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Positive feedback</h2>
	<p>The rules governing feedback are subjective.</p>
	<p>Some players prefer very difficult games, while others prefer simple games.</p>  
	<p>The idea of <note>positive feedback</note> is less subjective.  All games require the player to understand how the game is meant to be interacted with.</p>  
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Feedback that is easy to understand and motivates the player to developer their skill is positive.</p> 
	<p>Feedback that is confusing to the user or discourages further gameplay is negative.</p>  
	<p>For example, although dying in a game is not the desired outcome, it can be considered positive feedback if it teaches the user something important about the game world and rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Game essentials</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The rules of the game are easy to learn (not necessarily easy to master)</li>
		<li>The user is in direct control of the game avatar</li>
		<li>Improvement of skill through gameplay</li>
		<li>Immediate feedback</li>
		<li>Sufficient feedback</li>
		<li>Recovery from mistakes</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Game mechanics</h2>
	<p>Game mechanics are the system of rules that governs the way a user interacts with a game.</p>
	<p>Game mechanics build up within in a game to create a complex world.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The interface allows the user to make actions</li>
		<li>The game records the action and makes decisions based on the input and environment</li>
		<li>Feedback in the form of changing game states is given to the user</li>
		<li>The user interprets the feedback and adjusts and continues actions</li>
	</ul>
	
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Goals, obstacles and rewards</h2>
	<p>Most games have established goals, whether they're specific, like saving the princess, or vague, like exploring an abandoned island.</p>
	<p>Games use obstacles and rewards to lead the player toward goals and provide challenges to reaching those goals.  The line between goal, obstacle and reward can often be blurred.</p>
	<p>Complex games often have a variety of obstacles and rewards and multiple goals that are either sequenced or occurring contemporaneously.  These elements add up to make a complex game world with multiple possibilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Goals can be objectives for the player to progress through a game or win the game.  Many games have one main goal and several side goals.</p>
	<p>Goals can be compounded to create a complex series of events.  You may need to defeat several groups of enemies before reaching a level boss, and several level bosses before reaching the final boss of the game.</p>
	<p>You may also have side goals that have nothing to do with the main goal of the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Obstacles</h2>
	<p>Also referred to as challenges, obstacles are puzzles, enemies or other obstacles that prevent the player from achieving goals.  Sometimes challenges help lead player towards the goals.</p>
	<p>Obstacles are usually dependent on the game genre.  In a puzzle based game you may have to solve math or logic based puzzles, either with limited or unlimited time.  In a shooting game, your obstacles are usually enemies.  In some games obstacles are more abstract, like locating items or characters, or deciding to choose different branches of a story.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Rewards</h2>
	<p>Rewards can take the form of currency, objects, visual rewards or other items given to the player for completing challenges or defeating obstacles.</p>
	<p>Rewards help tell the player that they are playing correctly and moving in the correct direction.</p>
	<p>Some rewards may be purely aesthetic and non-functional, like new graphics for the character.</p>
	<p>Many rewards effect the game play, such as enhancing aspects of the player or revealing new parts of the game.</p>
